Sweet and Sour Meatballs over noodles
Prep time: 2 minutes
Cook time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

* Two 3-oz packages ramen noodles (save seasoning packets for another use)

* 12-oz package cooked turkey meatballs, cut in half

* 16-oz bag frozen Asian stir-fry vegetables, thawed

* 3/4 cup sweet-and-sour sauce (in the Asian-food section of grocery store)

* 1/2 cup reduced-sodium, fat-free chicken broth

1. Boil 4 cups water in a covered pot over high heat. Break noodles in thirds (for easier serving); add to water. Reduce heat to simmer and cook, uncovered, 3 minutes, stirring. Drain; keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover; simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until meatballs are heated through and vegetables are crips-tender. If pot bubbles too vigorously, reduce heat to medium. Serve over noodles.
